Overriding
when we have same methods in parent and child classes.
1) there should be a parent child relationship between the classes.
2) the return type,name and parameters of the method they should be same
3)we can not override private methods/Constructors because they don't participate
in inheritance
4) We can not decrease the visibility of a method being overwritten but we can increase
5) when it comes to static methods we say that we are re-declaring a method instead of
overriding it

Overriding:
when same method with same return type and same signature(name,parameters)
exists in two classes which have inheritance relationship

When we have same methods in the parent child classes with static modifier we say that we
are hiding a method by re-declaring it instead of overriding a method
